test example


That's what you asked me to do. 
as a backend developer I took care of more the api code and postman collection than dashboard code 
The API code takes into account all cases and validation and authentication,
I tried to be code as brief and understandable as possible,
in addition to simple dashboard for the admin to manage the website and take care of the cases too I wish to send notes and thank you

To be able to browse the dashboard you need an admin account that you can create by seeder :

php artisan db:seed --class=CreateAdminUserSeeder

I'll attach a postman collection
